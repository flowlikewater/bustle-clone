    "body": "In honor of their 160th birthday, The Atlantic launched a project this week that can show you how much the world has changed since you were born. All you need to do is input your birthday, and the timeline lists 10 to 13 milestone events that have happened in your lifetime, as well as looking back to just before your birth and making some projections about what might happen in the future. It's fun, yes — but it also provides some valuable perspective which is all the more necessary in our current times. The project uses The Atlantic’s vast archives to show you your place in time among events in modern history. It notes everything from movie releases to technologic innovations to international news stories; then it pairs them with pieces published in The Atlantic to give you some perspective on what’s changed in your lifetime. For example, if you were born in 1990, you were one of the first people who’s never lived in a world without Game Boys. Are you a 1999 baby? You’re one of the first to have never seen a world without Google. If you were born in ‘85, you’re part of the generation who’s never lived in a world without Macintosh computers.",
